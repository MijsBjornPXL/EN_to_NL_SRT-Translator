# Eng2NL_SRT_Translator


### English to Dutch Subtitle Translation and File Renaming Script

This Python script processes subtitle files, translates them from English to Dutch, and renames the resulting files accordingly. It handles `.en.srt` and `.srt` files and uses the `translatepy` library to perform the translation.

## Features

- Processes `.en.srt` and `.srt` subtitle files in the specified directory.
- Translates the subtitle content from English to Dutch using the `translatepy` library.
- Cleans up timestamp formatting to ensure proper spacing and arrow formatting.
- Renames processed files from `.en.srt` to `.nld.srt`.
- Writes the translated subtitles to a temporary file, cleans the content, and then renames and moves the final subtitle file back to the source directory.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `translatepy` for translation.
- `shutil` for file operations (comes with Python).
- `re` (comes with Python) for regular expression operations.


## Dependencies

1. **translatepy**: A Python library for translation.

   Install it with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install translatepy


Python: Make sure Python 3.x is installed.

## Installation Instructions

Clone the repository or download the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MijsBjornPXL/Eng2NL_SRT_Translator.git
cd Eng2NL_SRT_Translator
```

### Run the script:

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the script. It will prompt you to enter the directory where your subtitle files are located.

Example:

```bash
python SubtitleTranslationScript.py
```

### Directory Structure:

The script processes files in the given directory and renames them as follows:

.en.srt files will be renamed to .nld.srt after translation.
.srt files will be renamed to .nld.srt after translation.

## Example Use Case

Place all the .en.srt and .srt subtitle files you want to translate in the same folder.
Run the script and provide the source directory.

The script will:
Process each file in chunks.
Translate the text content from English to Dutch.
Clean up the timestamps.
Save the new file with the .nld.srt extension in the same folder.
